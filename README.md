# jsongenerator

Json generator is used for generating fake data in your db. Suppose your project needs large amount of data and you need the data before your project is completed or generated by the users, you can do so by following some steps and running the Json Generator. Here are the steps to get you up and running with jsongenerator.:
1)You have to write your collection schema in the jsonSchema.js.
2)Export the sceme module using module.exports = mongoose.modal('collection',schama)
3)In the index.js, Create a a pool of ids which you use for each collection.NOTE:Generate the ids in the pool only if you are synchronizing the ids with collection. i.e If one collection has that id as ref with another collection.
4)Write down the schema of the collection with types and format . NOTE: see jsonfaker for more info on formats
5)Write suitable functions and queries that you want the collections to be synced.
6)Run the code by node index.js
